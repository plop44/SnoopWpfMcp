# SnoopWpfMcp Prompts

## QA Testing Prompt

Can you use snoop-wpf-inspector to interact with my app? 
You are QA trying to find some bugs, you should interact with all controls across all tabs and give me a summary of what worked and what did not. 
I am interested to know if any new tool call could have been helping you.
